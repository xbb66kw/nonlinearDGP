# nonlinearDGP
A algorithm that can detect the relevant variables under the nonlinear 
DGP setting.

This very first edtion is far from prepared. The nonlinearOGA.r file contains 
all the util functions and core functions for the OGA algorithm. The specification 
of each function will be uploaded in some future time.

The dependency of this algorithm requires Rcpp, inline and especially 
RcppArmadillo. The rest R package can be easily installed by the usual 
process.

After running the nonlinearOGA.r file, you can test the algorithm by running 
example file. Currently the algorithm is written in the example files.

to convert tabs into spaces. All files are kept in 4 spaces indentents.
